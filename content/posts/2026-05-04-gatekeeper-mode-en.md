# GateKeeper Mode: Building a Quality Gate Before Letting AI Touch Your Code

> **Core thesis**: Once AI can write code, the bottleneck is no longer "can it produce a patch?" — it's "can the system prove that patch should be accepted?"

## 1. Why "AI Wrote the Code" Is Not the Hard Part

If you've been using AI to assist with coding for any length of time, you've probably run a workflow that looks something like this:

1. Write a prompt, ask an agent to implement something
2. Have another agent (or the same one) scan the diff for problems
3. Quickly skim through the changes yourself
4. Run the tests, merge if they pass

This works fine for simple tasks. But it hides several assumptions that will explode simultaneously once the scope grows.

**Friendly-reviewer bias.** When you ask AI to review code that AI wrote, the reviewer naturally tends to approve rather than challenge. It sees an implementation that runs, reads reasonably well, and doesn't spontaneously ask "is this `except Exception` catching too much?" It has no incentive to nitpick, and no standard independent of the patch to compare against.

**Tests passing ≠ behavior correct.** Tests cover what tests were written to cover, not what the requirements actually demand. If your requirement is "only catch `ZeroDivisionError`, no over-catching allowed," a test suite that goes 4/4 proves absolutely nothing about that constraint. Tests passing is evidence — it is not proof that every requirement is satisfied.

**Missing evidence treated as acceptable.** When a Critic finds no problems, it is usually interpreted as "there are no problems," not as "there is no evidence of problems." Those two things are not the same.

**Manual review fatigue.** By the time you actually want to read a diff carefully, you've already read through ten rounds of conversation history. Your attention is no longer on the things that matter.

**Agent modified files outside the intended scope.** Without an explicit boundary, an agent will happily touch files it considers "related." Those changes sometimes don't cause errors but quietly alter system behavior.

**Multi-turn conversation drift that's hard to trace.** After three rounds, who changed what, why they changed it, and what the last failure was — all of that is scattered through conversation history and takes real time to reconstruct.

None of these problems exist because AI is not smart enough. They are workflow design problems. AI can already produce plausible patches. The real challenge is: **do you have a system that can deterministically tell you whether a given patch should be accepted?**

---

## 2. Internal Adversarial Review

GateKeeper Mode is not a better prompt. It is a workflow with separated roles. The key design decision is: **split the Critic's work into two distinct points in time**.

In an ordinary AI review workflow, the Critic appears after the patch: it sees the implementation, then forms an opinion. This means the Critic's judgment is already influenced by how the Builder chose to implement things — it sees something that works, reads as reasonable, and the bar for criticism naturally rises.

GateKeeper Mode moves the Critic's work earlier:

| Ordinary AI Review | GateKeeper Mode |
|---|---|
| Critic appears after the patch | Critic defines evidence standard before the patch |
| Review is impression-based | Review is checklist + deterministic evidence |
| Tests are optional background | Executor is a hard gate — exit code decides |
| Approval can be vague | Malformed approval defaults to reject |
| Human re-reads everything | Human reads only final_decision.md |
| One-shot interaction | Reject carries evidence into retry; Builder sees the failure reason |

**The burden of proof is on the patch, not on the rejection.**

The Critic does not need to explain why it rejected. It only needs to say: these three checklist items have no corresponding evidence. If the Builder's patch didn't satisfy those items, it should be rejected — no further justification required. Absence of evidence is the default verdict: FAILED.

## 3. From GateKeeper Lite to Full GateKeeper Mode

This design evolved incrementally. It didn't start out this complete.

The earliest version (Lite) looked like this:

```
Builder → Executor → Critic
```

Builder writes code, Executor runs tests, Critic reviews after it has both the patch and the execution log. This is already much better than purely manual: execution results are deterministic, the Critic's review has a log to reference, and the human only needs to read the Critic's conclusion.

But there's an inherent contradiction: the Critic's evaluation standard forms only after seeing the patch. It's very hard to be truly independent of the Builder's implementation choices. Seeing something that "works," it naturally approaches from "is there something wrong here?" rather than "does this implementation satisfy each pre-defined requirement?"

The key upgrade in the full version is adding **Critic-Prep**:

```
Critic-Prep → Builder → Executor → Critic-Review
```

Critic-Prep happens before the Builder starts. It reads the brief (task description) and the list of allowed files, and writes an acceptance checklist. This checklist is not a vague wish list — it is a specific, item-by-item set of evidence standards, precise down to function signatures, expected return values for edge cases, and which files must not be touched.

Then the Builder writes code with no knowledge that the checklist exists. This is intentional: the Builder can't see the checklist, so its implementation won't be guided by the checklist's phrasing, and the Critic-Review's judgment won't be contaminated by the Builder's implementation style.

**The Critic is valuable precisely because it defines the evidence standard before the Builder can influence it.**

---

## 4. Local CLI Implementation

This entire workflow runs locally. No framework required.

| Role | Tool | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Builder | Claude Code (CLI) | Writes the patch, isolated in a git worktree, never sees the checklist |
| Critic-Prep | Codex (CLI) | Reads brief + allowed_files, writes acceptance checklist |
| Executor | Shell script | Compile + test + evaluator, exit code decides pass/fail |
| Critic-Review | Codex (CLI) | Reads patch.diff + eval.log, verifies each checklist item against evidence |
| Judge | Shell script | Parses Critic output, writes final_decision.md, decides APPROVE / REJECT / ESCALATE |
| Human | User | Reads only final_decision.md — no need to watch every intermediate turn |

Each GateKeeper run executes in an isolated git worktree and produces: `critic_checklist.md`, `patch.diff`, `eval.log`, `critic_review.md`, `final_decision.md`. These files are the complete evidence chain, and the only basis for later traceability.

Why not AutoGen or LangGraph? Not because they're bad — but before there is deterministic evidence that the workflow's semantics are correct, introducing a framework only makes debugging harder. Get the semantics right with visible files and logs first, then consider migration. Visible artifacts are easier to debug than framework abstractions. That's not a preference; it's hard experience.

---

## 5. The Four Gates

The full pipeline has four deterministic gates. Any one of them failing triggers a REJECT:

```
① scope gate:    allowed_files.txt constrains which files Builder can touch
                 Out-of-scope modifications → REJECT immediately, before Executor

② setup gate:    critic_checklist.md must exist and contain valid items
                 If Critic-Prep didn't succeed, Builder is not allowed to start

③ executor gate: build + test + evaluator exit codes
                 Any non-zero exit → REJECT, enter retry

④ critic gate:   each checklist item must have direct corresponding evidence
                 Vague "broadly satisfies" does not count; missing evidence → FAILED
```

The four gates are sequential. You must pass one before entering the next. This means scope-gate failures don't waste Executor time, and Executor failures don't waste Critic-Review time. The earlier a failure is found, the lower the cost.

## 6. Real Runs

**Small examples first to validate each path, then a real C++ project.** Scenarios one through four use intentionally simplified Python tasks — the goal is to make each path (one-pass, retry, ESCALATE, semantic reject) independently verifiable without introducing real-project compilation noise. Scenarios five and six are the results on a real project.

---

### Scenario 1: One-shot Pass (APPROVE on attempt 1)

**Run directory**: `gatekeeper_runs/20260503-173556/`

**Task**: Write a `safe_add` function in `python-utils/safe_add.py` that handles `None` inputs.

Critic-Prep wrote a 10-item checklist before the Builder started:

```
- [ ] File python-utils/safe_add.py defines function safe_add
- [ ] Function signature is exactly safe_add(a: float | None, b: float | None) -> float
- [ ] safe_add(10.0, 2.0) returns 12.0
- [ ] safe_add(None, 2.0) returns 0.0
- [ ] safe_add(10.0, None) returns 0.0
- [ ] safe_add(None, None) returns 0.0
- [ ] safe_add(-5.0, 3.0) returns -2.0
- [ ] File python-utils/test_safe_add.py exists and includes tests for all required cases
- [ ] Evaluator script scripts/evaluators/evaluate_safe_add.sh passes in executor log
- [ ] No files outside the allowed list are modified
```

These 10 items cover the exact function signature, expected return values for every edge case, test file existence, evaluator pass status, and file scope constraints. There is no room for the Builder to misinterpret requirements.

```
final_decision.md:
  Final verdict: APPROVE
  Attempts used: 1 / 3
  Gate: CRITIC — All checklist items have direct evidence
```

Attempt 1 passed directly. When the evidence standard is specific enough, a one-shot pass is not luck — it is inevitable.

---

### Scenario 2: Deterministic Retry (RETRY → APPROVE)

**Run directory**: `gatekeeper_runs/20260503-173731/`

**Task**: Deliberately designed so Attempt 1 must fail (evaluator returns exit 1 on first execution), to verify that the retry mechanism itself works.

Attempt 1 `eval.log` tail:

```
Attempt number: 1
FAIL: First attempt intentionally fails to trigger retry
This is a deterministic test for retry logic.
```

Judge parses the EXECUTOR gate failure and triggers a retry. Builder receives the full failure evidence from Attempt 1 — including the complete `eval.log` and the specific checklist items that lacked evidence — and re-implements.

```
final_decision.md:
  Final verdict: APPROVE
  Attempts used: 2 / 3

  Attempt 1: REJECT — Gate: EXECUTOR (exit code 1)
  Attempt 2: APPROVE — Gate: CRITIC
```

The key design of the retry mechanism: REJECT doesn't just return "failure" — it carries the complete evidence to the next round's Builder. Builder sees which gate failed, what the failure reason was, and which checklist items had no evidence. That is substantially more informative than a bare "retry." The retry's efficiency comes from precise evidence transfer, not from the Builder guessing better.

---

### Scenario 3: Retry Limit Exceeded (ESCALATE)

**Run directory**: `gatekeeper_runs/20260503-173917/`

**Task**: Both attempts fail deterministically (`max_attempts=2`), to validate the ESCALATE path.

```
final_decision.md:
  Final verdict: ESCALATE
  Attempts used: 2 / 2

  Attempt 1: REJECT — Gate: EXECUTOR
  Attempt 2: REJECT — Gate: EXECUTOR
```

Cleanup commands and paths to all intermediate artifacts are included, waiting for human intervention.

ESCALATE is not "the process broke." It's the system saying: this task is beyond what can be handled automatically at this time, a human needs to look at it. `final_decision.md` gives the human a complete evidence chain — every round's eval.log, Critic-Review's item-by-item judgment, Judge's parsing result. The human reviews the evidence package; they do not need to re-read conversation history. ESCALATE's value is that it is a clear stopping point, not a silent failure endpoint.

---

### Scenario 4: Semantic Reject (Tests Pass, Critic Still Rejects)

**Run directory**: `gatekeeper_runs/20260503-153929/`

This is the scenario that best illustrates the value of the Critic gate.

**Task**: Implement `safe_divide`, with the requirement that it catches only `ZeroDivisionError` — no over-catching.

**Executor result**: 4/4 tests pass.

**Critic-Review judgment**:

```
Verdict: REJECT

3. Function catches ONLY ZeroDivisionError
   Evidence: FAILED — Patch shows except Exception:

6. No over-catching of unrelated exceptions
   Evidence: FAILED — except Exception: catches too much
```

The Builder wrote `except Exception`, which swallows every exception — including type errors, attribute errors, and other failures that callers should know about. Tests pass because the tests only cover the normal path and the divide-by-zero path; they never touch the constraint "only catch this specific exception."

**This is the core value of Critic-Prep.** It wrote "only catch a specific exception" into the checklist before seeing any code. That constraint is hidden and non-negotiable for the Builder. Without that pre-written checklist, this kind of semantic problem almost always slips through review — "4/4 tests pass, code reads reasonably" — the bar for approval is too low. This scenario also validates something more important: if you only look at the Executor gate, you'd think the patch already passed. Semantic correctness requires the Critic gate. Neither gate alone is sufficient.

---

### Scenario 5: Real C++ Project (cpp-trader-backtester)

**Run directory**: `gatekeeper_runs/20260503-205323/`

**Task**: Add a volume consistency invariant test to a C++ order book implementation. Real project, real C++ compilation, Debug/ASan build.

Critic-Prep pre-wrote a 13-item checklist:

```
- [ ] Only cpp-trader-backtester/src/test_order_book.cpp is modified
- [ ] New function test_volume_invariant() exists
- [ ] Test records executed quantity via set_trade_callback
- [ ] Test verifies remaining resting volume after matching
- [ ] Test explicitly checks: executed_quantity + remaining_volume == total_submitted_quantity
- [ ] Build passes according to evaluate_cpp_trader.sh
- [ ] All order book tests pass
- [ ] No production files are changed
...（13 items total）
```

The checklist covers file scope (only `test_order_book.cpp` may be changed), the test function name, three specific verification points in the test logic, build pass status, and a constraint that production files must not be touched. Every item is something that can be found as direct evidence in `patch.diff` or `eval.log` — not a single item is a subjective "broadly satisfies" judgment.

```
Attempt 1: REJECT — Gate: CRITIC
  Missing explicit verification that executed quantity
  equals expected matched quantity.

Attempt 2: APPROVE — Gate: CRITIC
  All checklist items have direct evidence.
```

In Attempt 1, the Builder verified the remaining quantity but didn't explicitly assert that the executed quantity equals the expected value — the invariant `executed_quantity + remaining_volume == total_submitted_quantity` had its `remaining_volume` side checked but not the `executed_quantity` side. Critic-Prep's checklist had this item explicitly, so the omission was precisely located. Attempt 2 added the missing assertion and passed.

This kind of omission is extremely easy to miss in an ordinary code review: the implementation looks complete, the tests pass, and only cross-checking against the pre-written acceptance standard item by item reveals "it asserted remaining, not executed."

---

### Scenario 6: Stress Test ESCALATE (Exposing the Evaluator's Own Weakness)

**Run directory**: `gatekeeper_runs/20260503-214848/`

This is the most valuable scenario in this article, and the most honest one.

**Task**: Fix the strategy layer's ownership validation and fill accounting. More complex than the invariant test — involves multiple files, requires the strategy layer logic to cooperate.

```
final_decision.md:
  Final verdict: ESCALATE
  Attempts used: 3 / 3

  Attempt 1: REJECT — Gate: CRITIC
    Missing evidence that production strategy tests verify owned buy/sell fills.
    Executor log suggests assertions were disabled.

  Attempt 2: REJECT — Gate: CRITIC
    Owned fill behavior is not proven; executor output shows expected position
    updates did not occur while tests still reported PASS.

  Attempt 3: REJECT — Gate: EXECUTOR (exit code 1)
```

Attempt 1's Critic identified a critical clue (written by Codex):

```
Checklist item: MomentumStrategy::on_trade ignores unrelated trades
Evidence: FAILED — executor log shows assertions were disabled via -DNDEBUG.
Tests that passed may not have actually checked the assertions.
```

This sentence points to the root cause.

The fix is straightforward: the evaluator was updated to build tests in Debug/ASan mode; the Release build is used only for benchmark smoke testing.

This ESCALATE is a valuable result, not a process failure. **GateKeeper is not just a patch filter — it is a tool for debugging the quality system itself.** Without the Critic insisting on evidence, the `-DNDEBUG` problem could have persisted indefinitely in "behavior is strange but tests are green" form, leaving a silent hole in every subsequent test result. Three ESCALATEs that exposed the evaluator's own quality issue — that outcome is worth more than any single APPROVE.

## 7. Callback Ordering: A Design Bug Exposed Along the Way

The strategy accounting task also surfaced a synchronous design issue unrelated to the GateKeeper workflow itself — but one that only got taken seriously because the workflow forced a close look at the evidence.

The problem is in the call ordering:

```
submit_order()
  → add_order()
    → match_order()
      → execute_trade()
        → trade_callback_()    # Strategy::on_trade executes here
  → return order_id            # too late — strategy couldn't pre-register the id
```

This is not a multithreaded race. It is a synchronous callback reentrancy ordering problem. When `on_trade` is called, `submit_order()` hasn't returned yet, so the caller doesn't have the `order_id`. The strategy, when it receives a fill callback, has no way to determine whether that fill belongs to an order it submitted. The bug causes no exceptions; tests pass (while assertions are disabled) — it lives as "behavior is strange but logs look normal."

The fix is a two-phase API: `prepare_order()` returns the `order_id` synchronously first; the strategy records it, then calls `submit_prepared_order()` to trigger matching. Only after that does ownership verification have a correct temporal anchor point.

This bug was not something GateKeeper was designed to detect, nor was it GateKeeper that introduced it. But if not for insisting on seeing evidence during the ownership validation run, it would likely have continued to exist quietly for a long time. Critic-Prep's checklist required "evidence that `on_trade` correctly identifies its own fills" — that requirement forced the implementer to face the ordering problem head-on, with no way to route around it.

## 8. What This Doesn't Solve Yet

Honesty about the boundaries:

**It is not a stronger-prompt technique.** GateKeeper Mode changes workflow structure, not the quality of a single conversation. If your task requires a smarter agent, this system doesn't solve that problem.

**It cannot replace domain tests.** GateKeeper ensures the items in the checklist have evidence — but checklist quality depends on the quality of Critic-Prep's input. If the brief is incomplete, the checklist won't cover all requirements. The evaluator can only guarantee what it tests.

**It cannot prove an agent is always correct.** A passing patch is "a patch accepted under the current checklist and test coverage" — it is not "an eternally correct patch." These two things are different and should not be conflated.

**The Attacker role is not yet wired in.** The full design would have an Attacker role, before Critic-Review, that actively tries to break the patch with boundary inputs and adversarially constructed scenarios, passing its results as additional evidence to the Critic. That hasn't been implemented. The current quality gates are all defensive — none are actively adversarial. This is the next thing to build.

And the most important of all:

> **An Executor gate is only as strong as the commands it runs. If tests depend on `assert()`, running them under `-DNDEBUG` turns the quality gate into a smoke test.**

This is not a GateKeeper problem — it is the user's responsibility. GateKeeper's value is in making that weakness visible. But fixing it requires the user to act. Visibility is a precondition; action is the user's job.

## 9. Why This Matters for Agent-Assisted Optimization

If you want an agent to help with performance optimization — reduce memory allocations, optimize hot paths, adjust data structure layouts — you need to confirm one thing first: **do you have the ability to prove that the code's behavior after the optimization is consistent with before?**

Performance optimization is, at its core, changing the implementation without changing the semantics. If your correctness gates are still fuzzy, test results passing after an optimization only tell you "it runs" — they don't tell you "the semantics didn't change." You're likely to end up with a version that runs faster but whose behavior has quietly shifted, and tracing which step introduced the problem becomes very difficult. That kind of drift almost never surfaces immediately: the performance numbers look good, the tests are still green, and the problem appears in production as a low-probability anomaly with a broken traceability chain.

**Before correctness and evidence gates are in place, you should not let an agent do performance optimization.**

This is the subject of Blog 2. The infrastructure GateKeeper Mode provides — deterministic scope gate, independent Critic-Prep, evidence-backed checklist, Debug/ASan Executor — is the prerequisite for letting an agent safely perform performance optimization. Get the correctness proof right, and performance optimization becomes meaningful. Skip this step, and you're building on a foundation that doesn't exist.

## If You Want to Try This

The scripts, brief templates, and complete run records for all six scenarios are in the `gatekeeper_runs/` directory (each subdirectory is named by run timestamp, with the full artifact chain preserved). Each run directory contains the complete evidence chain from brief to final verdict: `critic_checklist.md` → `patch.diff` → `eval.log` → `critic_review.md` → `final_decision.md`.

Start with a small task where you already have tests: write a brief, let Critic-Prep generate the checklist, then let Builder work — but before reading the Builder's implementation, read the checklist first. That ordering itself will let you feel the difference between "evidence standard precedes the patch" and "reviewing after the patch already exists." If the feel is off, adjust; but experience it once first.
